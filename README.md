# Business-Insights-360
Objective: To develop a Power BI dashboard to empower the company with data-driven decision-making and actionable insights.

## Situation:
AtliQ Hardware, an imaginery company which sell hardware (like PCs and keyboard) expanded in to the Latin America but failed and suffered huge loss there.
The decision was made without data and relied only on intuition, Now they want to ensure future decisions are data driven.

## Task:
My task was to design and develop a Power BI dashboard that provides a 360-degree business insight, enabling stakeholders to track key metrics across Finance, Sales, Supply Chain, and Marketing expenses efficiently.

## Action:
#### 1. Data Modeling (Snowflake Schema)
- Established relationships between tables(Snowflake Schema) to enhance data integrity and performance.
