Objective: To develop a Power BI dashboard to empower the company with data-driven decision-making and actionable insights.

## Situation:
AtliQ Hardware, an imaginery company which sell hardware (like PCs and keyboard) expanded in to the Latin America but failed and suffered huge loss there.
The decision was made without data and relied only on intuition, Now they want to ensure future decisions are data driven.

## Task:

## Action:
